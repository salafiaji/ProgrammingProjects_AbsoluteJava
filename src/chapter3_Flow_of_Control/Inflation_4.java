 * Question:
 * It is difficult to make a budget that spans several years, because prices are not stable.
 * If your company needs 200 pencils per year, you cannot simply use this yearâ€™s price
 * as the cost of pencils two years from now. Because of inflation, the cost is likely to
 * be higher than it is today. Write a program to gauge the expected cost of an item in
 * a specified number of years. The program asks for the cost of the item, the number
 * of years from now that the item will be purchased, and the rate of inflation. The
 * program then outputs the estimated cost of the item after the specified period.
 * Have the user enter the inflation rate as a percentage, such as 5.6 (percent). Your
 * program should then convert the percent to a fraction, such as 0.056 and should
 * use a loop to estimate the price adjusted for inflation.
